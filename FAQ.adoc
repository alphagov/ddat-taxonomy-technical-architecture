= Frequently asked questions

== Why have a community version of the taxonomy?

It exists to support the official version and to help answer questions on adopting and adapting the framework to other needs across government.

It will also provide a way to trial and publicise changes to the taxonomy ahead of making a change to the official version. We should be able to experiment more freely with the community version and then only retain useful changes in the official version, which will have a more rigourous sign-off process.

== Why is the community version on Github?

In discussions with community members publishing on Github was the most popular option. In addition having a Git-based version provides all the auditing and change control systems the Professions team wanted for the community version.

== Why did you use Asciidoc instead of Markdown?

Because the original documents had a lot of tables that I didn't want to have deal with in raw HTML.
